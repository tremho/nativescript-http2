/**
 * This is the base class for the Http2 implementation.
 * It defines the public API and any common implementation between platforms
 *
 * See http2.android.ts and http2.ios.ts for platform implementation code
 *
 * This API is modeled after the Node http2 API, and many of the class structure and constants defined here
 * were copied from the Node docs.  However, implementation is limited to the immediate needs of this plugin
 * for its original use, and therefore many of the options described here may be unimplemented in early versions.

export class Http2ConnectOptions {
    maxDeflateDynamicTableSize: number = 4096 //Sets the maximum dynamic table size for deflating header fields. Default: 4Kib.
    maxSettings: number = 32 //Sets the maximum number of settings entries per SETTINGS frame. The minimum value allowed is 1. Default: 32.
    maxSessionMemory: number = 10 // Sets the maximum memory that the Http2Session is permitted to use. The value is expressed in terms of number of megabytes, e.g. 1 equal 1 megabyte. The minimum value allowed is 1. This is a credit based limit, existing Http2Streams may cause this limit to be exceeded, but new Http2Stream instances will be rejected while this limit is exceeded. The current number of Http2Stream sessions, the current memory use of the header compression tables, current data queued to be sent, and unacknowledged PING and SETTINGS frames are all counted towards the current limit. Default: 10.
    maxHeaderListPairs: number = 128 // Sets the maximum number of header entries. This is similar to http.Server#maxHeadersCount or http.ClientRequest#maxHeadersCount. The minimum value is 1. Default: 128.
    maxOutstandingPings: number = 10 //Sets the maximum number of outstanding, unacknowledged pings. Default: 10.
    maxReservedRemoteStreams: number = 200 // Sets the maximum number of reserved push streams the client will accept at any given time. Once the current number of currently reserved push streams exceeds reaches this limit, new push streams sent by the server will be automatically rejected. The minimum allowed value is 0. The maximum allowed value is 2232-1. A negative value sets this option to the maximum allowed value. Default: 200.
    maxSendHeaderBlockLength?: number // Sets the maximum allowed size for a serialized, compressed block of headers. Attempts to send headers that exceed this limit will result in a 'frameError' event being emitted and the stream being closed and destroyed.
    paddingStrategy: number = 0 //Strategy used for determining the amount of padding to use for HEADERS and DATA frames.
    // Default: http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_NONE. Value may be one of:
    // http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_NONE: No padding is applied.
    // http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_MAX: The maximum amount of padding, determined by the internal implementation, is applied.
    // http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_ALIGNED: Attempts to apply enough padding to ensure that the total frame length, including the 9-byte header, is a multiple of 8. For each frame, there is a maximum allowed number of padding bytes that is determined by current flow control state and settings. If this maximum is less than the calculated amount needed to ensure alignment, the maximum is used and the total frame length is not necessarily aligned at 8 bytes.

    peerMaxConcurrentStreams: number = 100 // Sets the maximum number of concurrent streams for the remote peer as if a SETTINGS frame had been received. Will be overridden if the remote peer sets its own value for maxConcurrentStreams. Default: 100.
    protocol: 'http:' | 'https:' = 'https:' // The protocol to connect with, if not set in the authority. Value may be either 'http:' or 'https:'. Default: 'https:'
    settings?:Http2Settings // The initial settings to send to the remote peer upon connection.
    createConnection?: CreateConnectionCallback // An optional callback that receives the URL instance passed to connect and the options object, and returns any Duplex stream that is to be used as the connection for this session.
    unknownProtocolTimeout: number = 10000 // Specifies a timeout in milliseconds that a server should wait when an 'unknownProtocol' event is emitted. If the socket has not been destroyed by that time the server will destroy it. Default: 10000.
    // ... Any net.connect() or tls.connect() options can be provided.
